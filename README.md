- 👋 Hi, I am Levi Davis, Founder and creator of the company. 
-  I'm currently working on making an ios App for interior and exterior design for both the metaverse and the real world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning swift code, but i am also in need of more people on our team, to short circuit development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with Developers who have access to X code and that use swift code, with individuals that are excited by the potential of creating
 a ground breaking App.
- 📫 Reach out to me at levidavis1000@gmail.com, with the Subject "DEV", we will then schedule a zoom call to look to onboard you as a Developer for the company.
